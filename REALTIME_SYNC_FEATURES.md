# Real-Time Sync and Queue Status Features

## Enhanced Initial Models Sync Dialog

The InitialModelSync.js dialog now provides comprehensive real-time feedback during model synchronization with the following enhancements:

### ðŸ”„ Per-Model Real-Time Status Tracking

- **Individual Model Status**: Each selected model shows its current status with color-coded badges:
  - ðŸŸ¡ **Queued**: Model is waiting to be downloaded
  - ðŸ”µ **Downloading**: Model is currently being downloaded (with pulsing animation)
  - ðŸŸ¢ **âœ“ Complete**: Model download finished successfully
  - ðŸ”´ **âœ— Failed**: Model download encountered an error
  - âš« **Cancelled**: Model download was cancelled

- **Progress Bars**: Models currently downloading show individual progress bars with:
  - Real-time progress percentage
  - Downloaded size vs. total size
  - Smooth gradient animation

### ðŸ“Š Enhanced Progress Monitoring

- **Overall Progress**: Master progress bar showing total sync completion
- **Speed Calculation**: Real-time download speed display (MB/s, KB/s, etc.)
- **ETA Estimation**: Estimated time remaining based on current download speed
- **Detailed Stats**: 
  - Completed/Total models count
  - Downloaded/Total size with formatting
  - Live speed measurements

### ðŸŽ¯ Queue Status Dashboard

- **Live Queue Information**: Real-time display showing:
  - Number of models currently downloading
  - Number of models queued and waiting
  - Names of currently downloading models (up to 3 shown)
  - Count of completed, failed, and cancelled downloads

- **Visual Indicators**: Queue status border changes color based on activity:
  - Blue: Active downloads in progress
  - Red: Failed downloads detected
  - Green: All downloads completed
  - Orange: Models queued but not yet started

### âš¡ Smart Retry System

- **Failed Download Detection**: Automatically identifies failed downloads
- **Retry Button**: Appears when downloads complete with failures
- **One-Click Retry**: Easily restart failed downloads without re-selecting
- **Status Reset**: Failed models reset to "queued" status when retried

### ðŸŽ¨ Visual Enhancements

- **Smooth Animations**: CSS transitions for status changes and progress updates
- **Pulsing Effects**: Downloading status badges pulse to indicate activity
- **Progress Shimmer**: Progress bars have animated shimmer effect
- **Color-Coded Feedback**: Consistent color scheme across all status indicators

### ðŸ“± User Experience Improvements

- **Non-Blocking Updates**: Progress updates every second without UI freezing
- **Contextual Information**: Shows which specific models are downloading
- **Completion Summary**: Detailed completion report with failed download list
- **Graceful Cancellation**: Proper cleanup when downloads are cancelled

## Technical Implementation

### Real-Time Polling
- Polls backend every 1000ms for progress updates
- Tracks download speed history for smooth ETA calculations
- Maintains progress history for average speed calculation

### Data Structure
- Organized by group > model hierarchy
- Tracks individual model progress, status, and metadata
- Maintains selected model state throughout sync process

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when API calls fail
- User-friendly error messages
- Automatic cleanup of intervals and event listeners

## Usage

The enhanced dialog automatically appears when:
1. Pod starts with models needing sync
2. User has previously existing models in S3
3. Models are not currently present on local storage

The real-time features activate immediately when sync begins, providing continuous feedback until completion or cancellation.

## Integration

- Fully integrated with existing backend API endpoints
- Compatible with shell-based download service
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing sync flow
- No changes required to backend for basic functionality

This implementation provides a professional, real-time user experience that keeps users informed about download progress, queue status, and any issues that arise during the sync process.
